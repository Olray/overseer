Overseer
The Open Source message-based debugging tool

Future Development:

I guess that current Overseer design&code is at dead-end, so I'll make new
one (V2.0) from scratch along COM/DCOM and with tight integration with NEXUS.
Until V2.0 has come to reality, I'll commit to some minor maintenance to current
version. Because current concept use WM_COPYDATA to pass messages around, this
version could be used with D2 (but forthcoming version can't be). If somebody
want backward compatibility with D2, I'm ready to pass V1.0 future into his hands
after V2.0 went out.

But in spite of my statements (see above), there are some enthusiastic
contributors who work hard on Overseer 1.x enhancements.
